  abstract = {Thermodynamics impose a major constraint on the structure of metabolic pathways. Here, we use carbon fixation pathways to demonstrate how thermodynamics shape the structure of pathways and determine the cellular resources they consume. We analyze the energetic profile of prototypical reactions and show that each reaction type displays a characteristic change in Gibbs energy. Specifically, although carbon fixation pathways display a considerable structural variability, they are all energetically constrained by two types of reactions: carboxylation and carboxyl reduction. In fact, all adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules consumed by carbon fixation pathways -- with a single exception -- are used, directly or indirectly, to power one of these unfavorable reactions. When an indirect coupling is employed, the energy released by ATP hydrolysis is used to establish another chemical bond with high energy of hydrolysis, e.g. a thioester. This bond is cleaved by a downstream enzyme to energize an unfavorable reaction. Notably, many pathways exhibit reduced ATP requirement as they couple unfavorable carboxylation or carboxyl reduction reactions to exergonic reactions other than ATP hydrolysis. In the most extreme example, the reductive acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) pathway bypasses almost all ATP-consuming reactions. On the other hand, the reductive pentose phosphate pathway appears to be the least ATP-efficient because it is the only carbon fixation pathway that invests ATP in metabolic aims other than carboxylation and carboxyl reduction. Altogether, our analysis indicates that basic thermodynamic considerations accurately predict the resource investment required to support a metabolic pathway and further identifies biochemical mechanisms that can decrease this requirement.},

Second, we demonstrate improved co-utilization of methanol and glucose by deleting the phosphoglucose isomerase gene (pgi), which rerouted glucose carbon flux through the oxidative PPP. Both strategies led to significant improvements in methanol assimilation as determined by 13C-labeling in intracellular metabolites. Introduction of an acetone-formation pathway in the pgi-deficient methylotrophic E. coli strain led to improved methanol utilization and acetone titers during glucose fed-batch fermentation.},

  abstract = {Significance              With the recent discoveries of large reserves of natural gas, the efficient utilization of one-carbon compounds for chemical synthesis would reduce the raw material cost for the petroleum-based chemical industry. Methanol is produced industrially from methane and is a feedstock chemical for the synthesis of higher carbon compounds. However, current chemical synthesis of higher carbon compounds from methanol requires high temperature and pressure. Natural biological pathways for methanol utilization are carbon and ATP inefficient. Here we constructed a synthetic biocatalytic pathway that allows the efficient conversion of methanol to higher-chain alcohols or other higher carbon compounds without carbon loss or ATP expenditure. The high carbon efficiency and favorable operating conditions are attractive for industrial applications.            ,                               Methanol is an important intermediate in the utilization of natural gas for synthesizing other feedstock chemicals. Typically, chemical approaches for building C--C bonds from methanol require high temperature and pressure. Biological conversion of methanol to longer carbon chain compounds is feasible; however, the natural biological pathways for methanol utilization involve carbon dioxide loss or ATP expenditure. Here we demonstrated a biocatalytic pathway, termed the methanol condensation cycle (MCC), by combining the nonoxidative glycolysis with the ribulose monophosphate pathway to convert methanol to higher-chain alcohols or other acetyl-CoA derivatives using enzymatic reactions in a carbon-conserved and ATP-independent system. We investigated the robustness of MCC and identified operational regions. We confirmed that the pathway forms a catalytic cycle through                13                C-carbon labeling. With a cell-free system, we demonstrated the conversion of methanol to ethanol or                n                -butanol. The high carbon efficiency and low operating temperature are attractive for transforming natural gas-derived methanol to longer-chain liquid fuels and other chemical derivatives.},

Although the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle used by methylotrophs to assimilate methanol differs from the typical sugar metabolism by only three enzymes, turning a non-methylotrophic organism to a synthetic methylotroph that grows to a high cell density has been challenging. Here we reprogrammed E.~coli using metabolic robustness criteria followed by laboratory evolution to establish a strain that can efficiently utilize methanol as the sole carbon source. This synthetic methylotroph alleviated a so far uncharacterized hurdle, DNA-protein crosslinking (DPC), by insertion sequence (IS)-mediated copy number variations (CNVs) and balanced the metabolic flux by mutations. Being capable of growing at a rate comparable with natural methylotrophs in a wide range of methanol concentrations, this synthetic methylotrophic strain illustrates genome editing and evolution for microbial tropism changes and expands the scope of biological C1 conversion.},

This phenomenon in microbial physiology has been a subject of study for over 100 years, elucidating a set of well-defined enzymatic systems and pathways enabling this capability. The knowledge gained from the early genetic and genomic approaches to understanding methylotrophy pointed towards the existence of alternative enzymes/pathways for the specific metabolic goals. Different combinations of these systems in different organisms suggested that methylotrophy must be modular in its nature. More recent insights from genomic analyses, including the genomes representing novel types of methylotrophs, seem to reinforce this notion. This review integrates the new findings with the previously developed concept of modularity of methylotrophy.},

Here, we propose criteria to evaluate these compounds, considering factors such as production methods, physicochemical properties, and microbial utilization. H2, CO, and formate emerge as the most promising electron donors as they can be produced electrochemically at high efficiency and, importantly, have reduction potentials low enough to directly reduce the cellular electron carriers.

Addressing these challenges may require a shift from the current model of industrial chemical manufacturing, which employs large-scale megafacilities that benefit from economies of unit scale. Contrary to the traditional approach, a model based on economies of unit number is proposed to reduce capital costs per unit capacity. Industrial biomanufacturing, which exploits biological processes for manufacturing, offers one way to address these changing global factors while using the economies of unit number model. This model employs both facility-level mass production of small-scale, modular units and improvements to process design resulting from repetition in a ``learning-by-doing'' approach. The lower investment and financial risk associated with smaller-scale, lower--capital cost facilities allow a larger number and more diverse group of technology players to be involved, in turn enabling faster innovation and novel technology adoption as well as a faster response to market drivers.                                            ADVANCES                In contrast to current chemical manufacturing methods, characteristics inherent to bioconversion processes---such as the ability to operate at mild temperatures and pressures and achieve high carbon- and energy-conversion efficiencies in single-unit operations---result in more streamlined and less technologically complex processes. These characteristics enable flexible, smaller-scale, and capital expenditure--efficient operation that can both support and benefit from a large number of facilities, according to the economies of unit number model. For example, the capital expenditure entry-level cost of corn-grain ethanol facilities, the most widely developed current example of a bioconversion process, has substantially decreased as the number of plants has increased over the past few decades. This has facilitated rapid, small-scale, and widespread deployment resulting in a more than 10-fold increase in U.S. ethanol production from 1995 to 2015.                                  Advances in metabolic engineering, synthetic biology, genomics, and industrial process design have pushed industrial biomanufacturing closer to more widespread adoption. Particular emphasis on single-carbon feedstocks, such as methane or CO                  2                  , in applications where large-scale chemical manufacturing is infeasible or too costly can leverage both economies of unit number for mass production of facilities and the benefits of manufacturing automation to reduce capital expenditure per unit scale. Current research efforts focused on the design of carbon- and energy-efficient metabolic pathways have been particularly beneficial. Advances in tool development for metabolic pathway design have included in silico organism design strategies, genome mining techniques, and computational enzyme design efforts. The integration of these with systems biology techniques, such as next-generation sequencing and high-sensitivity ``omics'' methods, has allowed for the design and potential development of millions of chemical production pathways. The use of genome engineering technologies---such as clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)--associated protein Cas9 systems and multiplex automated genomic engineering---and recent advances in screening and selecting for edited organisms using biosensors have reduced the time required to complete genomic editing to a fraction of the traditional time requirements. Automation-based process design improvements of these biotechnology advances have also facilitated rapid advances in industrial biomanufacturing.                                                            OUTLOOK                Continued development of industrial biomanufacturing in the 21st century will require further advances in biocatalyst design and process design engineering. To facilitate a future based on industrial biomanufacturing, further development of genomic tools and industrial design automations suited to these purposes is paramount. Furthermore, reducing the time required from concept design to industrial relevance is essential. Specific developments in the area of one-carbon feedstocks stand to exploit the opportunity presented by currently wasted, distributed methane through the increased adoption of an economy of unit numbers approach in industrial biomanufacturing. Although much work remains, the future of industrial biomanufacturing holds great promise in meeting the evolving demands of chemical production in the current century and beyond.                                                      Methane-based industrial biomanufacturing for fuel and chemical production.                    Exploiting biological processes can enable the conversion of single-carbon feedstocks, like methane, to the array of chemical products currently produced through industrial chemical manufacturing with considerable economic, environmental, and societal advantages.                                                                              ,               The current model for industrial chemical manufacturing employs large-scale megafacilities that benefit from economies of unit scale. However, this strategy faces environmental, geographical, political, and economic challenges associated with energy and manufacturing demands. We review how exploiting biological processes for manufacturing (i.e., industrial biomanufacturing) addresses these concerns while also supporting and benefiting from economies of unit number. Key to this approach is the inherent small scale and capital efficiency of bioprocesses and the ability of engineered biocatalysts to produce designer products at high carbon and energy efficiency with adjustable output, at high selectivity, and under mild process conditions. The biological conversion of single-carbon compounds represents a test bed to establish this paradigm, enabling rapid, mobile, and widespread deployment, access to remote and distributed resources, and adaptation to new and changing markets.},

  abstract = {Metabolic models condense biochemical knowledge about organisms in a structured and standardised way. As large-scale network reconstructions are readily available for many organisms, genome-scale models are being widely used among modellers and engineers. However, these large models can be difficult to analyse and visualise, and occasionally generate predictions that are hard to interpret or even biologically unrealistic. Of the thousands of enzymatic reactions in a typical bacterial metabolism, only a few hundred form the metabolic pathways essential to produce energy carriers and biosynthetic precursors. These pathways carry relatively high flux, are central to maintaining and reproducing the cell, and provide precursors and energy to engineered metabolic pathways. Focusing on these central metabolic subsystems, we present               i               CH360, a manually curated medium-scale model of energy and biosynthesis metabolism for the well-studied bacterium               Escherichia coli               K-12 MG1655. The model is a sub-network of the most recent genome-scale reconstruction,               i               ML1515, and comes with an updated layer of database annotations and a range of metabolic maps for visualisation. We enriched the stoichiometric network with extensive biological information and quantitative data, including thermodynamic and kinetic constants, enhancing the scope and applicability of the model. In addition, we assess the properties of this model in comparison to its genome-scale parent and demonstrate the use of the network and supporting data in various scenarios, including enzyme-constrained flux balance analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, and thermodynamic analysis. Overall, this model holds the potential to become a reference medium-scale metabolic model for               E. coli               .},

  abstract = {SUMMARY               An essential feature of bacterial plasmids is their ability to replicate as autonomous genetic elements in a controlled way within the host. Therefore, they can be used to explore the mechanisms involved in DNA replication and to analyze the different strategies that couple DNA replication to other critical events in the cell cycle. In this review, we focus on replication and its control in circular plasmids. Plasmid replication can be conveniently divided into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. The inability of DNA polymerases to initiate de novo replication makes necessary the independent generation of a primer. This is solved, in circular plasmids, by two main strategies: (i) opening of the strands followed by RNA priming (theta and strand displacement replication) or (ii) cleavage of one of the DNA strands to generate a 3{$\prime$}-OH end (rolling-circle replication). Initiation is catalyzed most frequently by one or a few plasmid-encoded initiation proteins that recognize plasmid-specific DNA sequences and determine the point from which replication starts (the origin of replication). In some cases, these proteins also participate directly in the generation of the primer. These initiators can also play the role of pilot proteins that guide the assembly of the host replisome at the plasmid origin. Elongation of plasmid replication is carried out basically by DNA polymerase III holoenzyme (and, in some cases, by DNA polymerase I at an early stage), with the participation of other host proteins that form the replisome. Termination of replication has specific requirements and implications for reinitiation, studies of which have started. The initiation stage plays an additional role: it is the stage at which mechanisms controlling replication operate. The objective of this control is to maintain a fixed concentration of plasmid molecules in a growing bacterial population (duplication of the plasmid pool paced with duplication of the bacterial population). The molecules involved directly in this control can be (i) RNA (antisense RNA), (ii) DNA sequences (iterons), or (iii) antisense RNA and proteins acting in concert. The control elements maintain an average frequency of one plasmid replication per plasmid copy per cell cycle and can ``sense'' and correct deviations from this average. Most of the current knowledge on plasmid replication and its control is based on the results of analyses performed with pure cultures under steady-state growth conditions. This knowledge sets important parameters needed to understand the maintenance of these genetic elements in mixed populations and under environmental conditions.},

Although regularly performed for more than 25 years, the advent of transcript and cheap next-generation sequencing technologies has resulted in many recent studies, which successfully applied this technique in order to engineer microbial cells for biotechnological applications. Adaptive laboratory evolution has some major benefits as compared with classical genetic engineering but also some inherent limitations. However, recent studies show how some of the limitations may be overcome in order to successfully incorporate adaptive laboratory evolution in microbial cell factory design. Over the last two decades important insights into nutrient and stress metabolism of relevant model species were acquired, whereas some other aspects such as niche-specific differences of non-conventional cell factories are not completely understood. Altogether the current status and its future perspectives highlight the importance and potential of adaptive laboratory evolution as approach in biotechnological engineering.},

Due to the successes with metabolism, there is an increasing effort to apply COBRA methods to reconstruct and analyze integrated models of cellular processes. The COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB is a leading software package for genome-scale analysis of metabolism; however, it was not designed to elegantly capture the complexity inherent in integrated biological networks and lacks an integration framework for the multiomics data used in systems biology. The openCOBRA Project is a community effort to promote constraints-based research through the distribution of freely available software.                                         Results               Here, we describe COBRA for Python (COBRApy), a Python package that provides support for basic COBRA methods. COBRApy is designed in an object-oriented fashion that facilitates the representation of the complex biological processes of metabolism and gene expression. COBRApy does not require MATLAB to function; however, it includes an interface to the COBRA Toolbox for MATLAB to facilitate use of legacy codes. For improved performance, COBRApy includes parallel processing support for computationally intensive processes.

Several levels of metabolic engineering can be defined and are the topic of this review. Basic `copy, paste and fine-tuning' approaches are limited to the structure of naturally existing pathways. `Mix and match' approaches freely recombine the repertoire of existing enzymes to create synthetic metabolic networks that are able to outcompete naturally evolved pathways or redirect flux toward non-natural products. The space of possible metabolic solution can be further increased through approaches including `new enzyme reactions', which are engineered on the basis of known enzyme mechanisms. Finally, by considering completely `novel enzyme chemistries' with de novo enzyme design, the limits of nature can be breached to derive the most advanced form of synthetic pathways.

Like most biotechnological production hosts, P. pastoris is heterotrophic and grows on organic feedstocks that have competing uses in the production of food and animal feed. In a step toward more sustainable industrial processes, we describe the conversion of P. pastoris into an autotroph that grows on CO2. By addition of eight heterologous genes and deletion of three native genes, we engineer the peroxisomal methanol-assimilation pathway of P. pastoris into a CO2 fixation pathway resembling the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, the predominant natural CO2 fixation pathway. The resulting strain can grow continuously with CO2 as a sole carbon source at a \textmu max of 0.008 h-1. The specific growth rate was further improved to 0.018 h-1 by adaptive laboratory evolution. This engineered P. pastoris strain may promote sustainability by sequestering the greenhouse gas CO2 and by avoiding consumption of an organic feedstock with alternative uses in food production.},

In spite of widespread interest in renewable energy storage and more sustainable food production, the engineering of industrially relevant heterotrophic model organisms to use CO2 as their sole carbon source has so far remained an outstanding challenge. Here, we report the achievement of this transformation on laboratory timescales. We constructed and evolved Escherichia coli to produce all its biomass carbon from CO2. Reducing power and energy, but not carbon,~are supplied via the one-carbon molecule formate, which can be produced electrochemically. Rubisco and phosphoribulokinase were co-expressed with formate dehydrogenase to enable CO2 fixation and reduction via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. Autotrophic growth was achieved following several months of continuous laboratory~evolution in a chemostat under intensifying organic~carbon limitation and confirmed via isotopic labeling.},

  abstract = {Abundant natural gas reserves, along with increased biogas production, have prompted recent interest in harnessing methane as an industrial feedstock for the production of liquid fuels and chemicals. Methane can either be used directly for fermentation or first oxidized to methanol via biological or chemical means. Methanol is advantageous due to its liquid state under normal conditions. Methylotrophy, defined as the ability of microorganisms to utilize reduced one-carbon compounds like methane and methanol as sole carbon and energy sources for growth, is widespread in bacterial communities. However, native methylotrophs lack the extensive and well-characterized synthetic biology toolbox of platform microorganisms like Escherichia coli, which results in slow and inefficient design-build-test cycles. If a heterologous production pathway can be engineered, the slow growth and uptake rates of native methylotrophs generally limit their industrial potential. Therefore, much focus has been placed on engineering synthetic methylotrophs, or non-methylotrophic platform microorganisms, like E. coli, that have been engineered with synthetic methanol utilization pathways. These platform hosts allow for rapid design-build-test cycles and are well-suited for industrial application at the current time. In this review, recent progress made toward synthetic methylotrophy (including methanotrophy) is discussed. Specifically, the importance of amino acid metabolism and alternative one-carbon assimilation pathways are detailed. A recent study that has achieved methane bioconversion to liquid chemicals in a synthetic E. coli methanotroph is also briefly discussed. We also discuss strategies for the way forward in order to realize the industrial potential of synthetic methanotrophs and methylotrophs.},

They are an interesting choice of bioreceptors as they allow flexibility in determining the sensing strategy, are cheaper than purified enzymes and antibodies and make the fabrication relatively simple and cost-effective. And with advances in the field of synthetic biology, microfluidics and lithography, many exciting developments have been made in the design of cell-based biosensors in the last about five years. 3D cell culture systems integrated with electrodes are now providing new insights into disease pathogenesis and physiology, while cardiomyocyte-integrated microelectrode array (MEA) technology is set to be standardized for the assessment of drug-induced cardiac toxicity. From cell microarrays for high-throughput applications to plasmonic devices for anti-microbial susceptibility testing and advent of microbial fuel cell biosensors, cell-based biosensors have evolved from being mere tools for detection of specific analytes to multi-parametric devices for real time monitoring and assessment. However, despite these advancements, challenges such as regeneration and storage life, heterogeneity in cell populations, high interference and high costs due to accessory instrumentation need to be addressed before the full potential of cell-based biosensors can be realized at a larger scale. This review summarizes results of the studies that have been conducted in the last five years toward the fabrication of cell-based biosensors for different applications with a comprehensive discussion on the challenges, future trends, and potential inputs needed for improving them.},

Their applications are linked to the use of strong methanol-inducible promoters derived from genes of the methanol utilisation pathway. These promoters are tightly regulated, highly repressed in presence of non-limiting concentrations of glucose in the medium and strongly induced if methanol is used as carbon source. Several factors involved in this tight control and their regulatory effects have been described so far. This review summarises available data about the regulation of promoters from methanol utilisation pathway genes. Furthermore, the role of cis and trans acting factors (e.g. transcription factors, glucose processing enzymes) in the expression of methanol utilisation pathway genes is reviewed both in the context of the native cell environment as well as in heterologous hosts.},

Overlap extension PCR is a valuable technique that is commonly used for cloning large complex fragments, making edits to cloned genes or fusing two gene elements together. After difficulties in utilizing this technique following existing methods, we developed an optimized protocol. To accomplish this, three significant changes were made; 1) touchdown PCR cycling parameters were used to eliminate the need for optimizing PCR cycling conditions, 2) the high-fidelity, high-processivity Q5 DNA polymerase was used to improve full-length amplification quality, and 3) a reduced amount of primer in the final PCR amplification step decreased non-specific amplimers. This modified protocol results in consistent generation of gene fusion products, with little to no background and enhanced efficiency of the transgene construction process.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                            The natural plasmid pBM19 carries the key               mdh               gene needed for the oxidation of methanol into formaldehyde by               Bacillus methanolicus               . Five more genes,               glpX               ,               fba               ,               tkt               ,               pfk               , and               rpe               , with deduced roles in the cell primary metabolism, are also located on this plasmid. By using real-time PCR, we show that they are transcriptionally upregulated (6- to 40-fold) in cells utilizing methanol; a similar induction was shown for two chromosomal genes,               hps               and               phi               . These seven genes are involved in the fructose bisphosphate aldolase/sedoheptulose bisphosphatase variant of the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway for formaldehyde assimilation. Curing of pBM19 causes higher methanol tolerance and reduced formaldehyde tolerance, and the methanol tolerance is reversed to wild-type levels by reintroducing               mdh               . Thus, the RuMP pathway is needed to detoxify the formaldehyde produced by the methanol dehydrogenase-mediated conversion of methanol, and the in vivo transcription levels of               mdh               and the RuMP pathway genes reflect the methanol tolerance level of the cells. The transcriptional inducer of               hps               and               phi               genes is formaldehyde, and not methanol, and introduction of multiple copies of these two genes into               B. methanolicus               made the cells more tolerant of growth on high methanol concentrations. The recombinant strain also had a significantly higher specific growth rate on methanol than the wild type. While pBM19 is critical for growth on methanol and important for formaldehyde detoxification, the maintenance of this plasmid represents a burden for               B. methanolicus               when growing on mannitol. Our data contribute to a new and fundamental understanding of the regulation of               B. methanolicus               methylotrophy.},

Here, a method was established that enables highly efficient and simultaneous deletion of multiple genes in Escherichia coli. A temperature sensitive plasmid containing arabinose inducible lambda Red recombineering genes and a rhamnose inducible flippase recombinase was constructed to facilitate fast marker-free deletions. To further speed up the procedure, we integrated the arabinose inducible lambda Red recombineering genes and the rhamnose inducible FLP into the genome of E. coli K-12\,MG1655. This system enables growth at 37\,{$^\circ$}C, thereby facilitating removal of integrated antibiotic cassettes and deletion of additional genes in the same day. Phosphorothioated primers were demonstrated to enable simultaneous deletions during one round of electroporation. Utilizing these methods, we constructed strains in which four to seven genes were deleted in E. coli W and E. coli K-12. The growth rate of an E. coli K-12 quintuple deletion strain was significantly improved in the presence of high concentrations of acetate and NaCl. In conclusion, we have generated a method that enables efficient and simultaneous deletion of multiple genes in several E. coli variants. The method enables deletion of up to seven genes in as little as seven days.},

Using a library of isopropyl {$\beta$}-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible mutant T7 promoters of varied strength a combinatorial method was developed for transcriptional balancing of the violacein pathway. Violacein biosynthesis involves a complex five-gene pathway that is an excellent model for exploratory metabolic engineering efforts into pathway regulation and control due to many colorful intermediates and side products allowing for easy analysis and strain comparison. Upon screening approximately 4\% of the total initial library, several high-titer mutants were discovered that resulted in up to a 63-fold improvement over the control strain. With further fermentation optimization, titers were improved to 1829\,\textpm\,46\,mg/L; a 2.6-fold improvement in titer and a 30-fold improvement in productivity from previous literature reports.},

Although progress has been made towards establishing               Escherichia coli               as a platform organism for methanol conversion via the energy efficient ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) cycle, engineering strains that rely solely on methanol as a carbon source remains challenging. Here, we apply flux balance analysis to comprehensively identify methanol-dependent strains with high potential for adaptive laboratory evolution. We further investigate two out of 1200 candidate strains, one with a deletion of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (               fbp               ) and another with triosephosphate isomerase (               tpiA               ) deleted. In contrast to previous reported methanol-dependent strains, both feature a complete RuMP cycle and incorporate methanol to a high degree, with up to 31 and 99\% fractional incorporation into RuMP cycle metabolites. These strains represent ideal starting points for evolution towards a fully methylotrophic lifestyle.},

It can be produced from CO2 or methane and its use does not compete with food and animal feed production. However, there are currently only limited biotechnological options for the valorization of methanol, which hinders its widespread adoption. Here, we report the conversion of the industrial platform organism Escherichia coli into a synthetic methylotroph that assimilates methanol via the energy efficient ribulose monophosphate cycle. Methylotrophy is achieved after evolution of a methanol-dependent E. coli strain over 250 generations in continuous chemostat culture. We demonstrate growth on methanol and biomass formation exclusively from the one-carbon source by 13C isotopic tracer analysis. In line with computational modeling, the methylotrophic E. coli strain optimizes methanol oxidation by upregulation of an improved methanol dehydrogenase, increasing ribulose monophosphate cycle activity, channeling carbon flux through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and downregulating tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. En route towards sustainable bioproduction processes, our work lays the foundation for the efficient utilization of methanol as the dominant carbon and energy resource.},

Sequential genomic introduction of the four metabolic modules of the synthetic pathway resulted in a strain capable of growth on formate and CO2 with a doubling time of \textasciitilde 70\,h and growth yield of \textasciitilde 1.5\,g cell dry weight (gCDW) per mol-formate. Short-term evolution decreased doubling time to less than 8\,h and improved biomass yield to 2.3\,gCDW per mol-formate. Growth on methanol and CO2 was achieved by further expression of a methanol dehydrogenase.

Hence, several biotechnologically important microorganisms have been recently engineered for fixing C1 substrates. However, reports about C1-based bioproduction with these organisms are scarce. Here, we describe the optimization of a previously engineered formatotrophic Escherichia coli strain. Short-term adaptive laboratory evolution enhanced biomass yield and accelerated growth of formatotrophic E. coli to 3.3 g-CDW/mol-formate and 6 hours doubling time, respectively. Genome sequence analysis revealed that manipulation of acetate metabolism is the reason for better growth performance, verified by subsequent reverse engineering of the parental E. coli strain. Moreover, the improved strain is capable of growing to an OD600 of 22 in bioreactor fed-batch experiments, highlighting its potential use for industrial bioprocesses. Finally, demonstrating the strain's potential to support a sustainable, formate-based bioeconomy, lactate production from formate and CO2 was engineered. The optimized strain generated 1.2 mM lactate---10 \% of the theoretical maximum---providing the first proof-of-concept application of the reductive glycine pathway for bioproduction.},

One of the key challenges for its bio-industrial application is the first enzymatic oxidation step to formaldehyde. This reaction is catalysed by methanol dehydrogenases (MDH) that can use NAD+, O2 or pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) as an electron acceptor. While NAD-dependent MDH are simple to express and have the highest energetic efficiency, they exhibit mediocre kinetics and poor thermodynamics at ambient temperatures. O2-dependent methanol oxidases require high oxygen concentrations, do not conserve energy and thus produce excessive heat as well as toxic H2O2. PQQ-dependent MDH provide a good compromise between energy efficiency and good kinetics that support fast growth rates without any drawbacks for process engineering. Therefore, we argue that this enzyme class represents a promising solution for industry and outline engineering strategies for the implementation of these complex systems in heterologous hosts.},

The Vision of the new Circular Bio-based Economy, CBE is presented: Unlocking the full potential of all types of sustainably sourced biomass, crop residues, industrial side-streams, and wastes by transforming it into value-added products. The resulting product portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of value-added products, addressing societal and consumer needs. Food and feed, bio-based chemicals, materials, health-promoting products; and bio-based fuels. The pillars of CBE are described, including biotechnology, microbial production, enzyme technology, green chemistry, integrated physical/chemical processing, policies, conducive framework conditions and public private partnerships. Drivers of CBE are analyzed: Biomass supply, biorefineries, value chain clusters, rural development, farmers, foresters and mariners; urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Improved framework conditions can be drivers but also obstacles if not updated to the era of circularity. Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014--2020) are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil. Parallel to this, diversification of industrial segments and types of funding instruments developed, reflecting industrial needs and academic research involvement. Impact assessment is highlighted. A number of specific recommendations are given; e.g., including international win/win CBE-collaborations, as e.g., expanding African EU collaboration into CBE. In contrast to fossil resources biological resources are found worldwide. In its outset, circular bio-based economy, can be implemented all over, in a just manner, not the least stimulating rural development.},

  abstract = {Methanol represents an attractive substrate for biotechnological applications. Utilization of reduced one-carbon compounds for growth is currently limited to methylotrophic organisms, and engineering synthetic methylotrophy remains a major challenge. Here we apply an in silico-guided multiple knockout approach to engineer a methanol-essential Escherichia coli strain, which contains the ribulose monophosphate cycle for methanol assimilation. Methanol conversion to biomass was stoichiometrically coupled to the metabolization of gluconate and the designed strain was subjected to laboratory evolution experiments. Evolved strains incorporate up to 24\% methanol into core metabolites under a co-consumption regime and utilize methanol at rates comparable to natural methylotrophs. Genome sequencing reveals mutations in genes coding for glutathione-dependent formaldehyde oxidation (frmA), NAD(H) homeostasis/biosynthesis (nadR), phosphopentomutase (deoB), and gluconate metabolism (gntR). This study demonstrates a successful metabolic re-routing linked to a heterologous pathway to achieve methanol-dependent growth and represents a crucial step in generating a fully synthetic methylotrophic organism.},

  abstract = {Methylotrophic bacteria utilize methanol and other reduced one-carbon compounds as their sole source of carbon and energy. For this purpose, these bacteria evolved a number of specialized enzymes and pathways. Here, we used a synthetic biology approach to select and introduce a set of ``methylotrophy genes'' into Escherichia coli based on in silico considerations and flux balance analysis to enable methanol dissimilation and assimilation. We determined that the most promising approach allowing the utilization of methanol was the implementation of NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase and the establishment of the ribulose monophosphate cycle by expressing the genes for hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase (Phi). To test for the best-performing enzymes in the heterologous host, a number of enzyme candidates from different donor organisms were selected and systematically analyzed for their in vitro and in vivo activities in E. coli. Among these, Mdh2, Hps and Phi originating from Bacillus methanolicus were found to be the most effective. Labeling experiments using 13C methanol with E. coli producing these enzymes showed up to 40\% incorporation of methanol into central metabolites. The presence of the endogenous glutathione-dependent formaldehyde oxidation pathway of E. coli did not adversely affect the methanol conversion rate. Taken together, the results of this study represent a major advancement towards establishing synthetic methylotrophs by gene transfer.},

Its capabilities of producing and secreting the commercially important amino acids l-glutamate and l-lysine to high concentrations at 50~{$^\circ$}C have been demonstrated and make B. methanolicus a promising target to develop cell factories for industrial-scale production processes. B. methanolicus uses the ribulose monophosphate cycle for methanol assimilation and represents the first example of plasmid-dependent methylotrophy. Recent genome sequencing of two physiologically different wild-type B. methanolicus strains, MGA3 and PB1, accompanied with transcriptome and proteome analyses has generated fundamental new insight into the metabolism of the species. In addition, multiple key enzymes representing methylotrophic and biosynthetic pathways have been biochemically characterized. All this, together with establishment of improved tools for gene expression, has opened opportunities for systems-level metabolic engineering of B. methanolicus. Here, we summarize the current status of its metabolism and biochemistry, available genetic tools, and its potential use in respect to overproduction of amino acids.},

  abstract = {Biochemical network reconstructions have become popular tools in systems biology. Metabolicnetwork reconstructions are biochemically, genetically, and genomically (BiGG) structured databases of biochemical reactions and metabolites. They contain information such as exact reaction stoichiometry, reaction reversibility, and the relationships between genes, proteins, and reactions. Network reconstructions have been used extensively to study the phenotypic behavior of wild-type and mutant stains under a variety of conditions, linking genotypes with phenotypes. Such phenotypic simulations have allowed for the prediction of growth after genetic manipulations, prediction of growth phenotypes after adaptive evolution, and prediction of essential genes. Additionally, because network reconstructions are organism specific, they can be used to understand differences between organisms of species in a functional context.There are different types of reconstructions representing various types of biological networks (metabolic, regulatory, transcription/translation). This chapter serves as an introduction to metabolic and regulatory network reconstructions and models and gives a complete description of the core                Escherichia coli                metabolic model. This model can be analyzed in any computational format (such as MATLAB or Mathematica) based on the information given in this chapter. The core                E. coli                model is a small-scale model that can be used for educational purposes. It is meant to be used by senior undergraduate and first-year graduate students learning about constraint-based modeling and systems biology. This model has enough reactions and pathways to enable interesting and insightful calculations, but it is also simple enough that the results of such calculations can be understoodeasily.},

Methylotrophic bacteria can utilize the one-carbon compound methanol as sole carbon source for growth, and metabolic engineering is being used to develop bioprocesses based on these organisms for conversion of methanol into value-added chemicals. Methylotrophic model strains include both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and in all cases methanol metabolism proceeds via the cell-toxic intermediate formaldehyde. Thus, understanding the genetics, biochemistry, and regulation of methylotrophic pathways is crucial for successful strain development and for their concomitant fermentations. Also, such basic knowledge has proven useful for design of strategies and approaches for the rational transfer of methylotrophy into non-methylotrophic bacteria.

Unlike methanol's chemical conversion, which requires high temperature and pressure, its biological conversion, proceeding through its oxidation to formaldehyde, takes place at ambient conditions but suffers from relative low rates. As metabolite biosynthesis by industrial organisms utilizes NADH as an electron donor, methanol oxidation must be carried out by NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenases, which have poor thermodynamic characteristics at mesophilic conditions. To solve this problem, we developed an engineering strategy for supramolecular enzyme assembly to dramatically enhance the carbon flux from methanol to the key intermediate fructose-6-phosphate.                          ,                               Methanol is an important feedstock derived from natural gas and can be chemically converted into commodity and specialty chemicals at high pressure and temperature. Although biological conversion of methanol can proceed at ambient conditions, there is a dearth of engineered microorganisms that use methanol to produce metabolites. In nature, methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh), which converts methanol to formaldehyde, highly favors the reverse reaction. Thus, efficient coupling with the irreversible sequestration of formaldehyde by 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase (Hps) and 6-phospho-3-hexuloseisomerase (Phi) serves as the key driving force to pull the pathway equilibrium toward central metabolism. An emerging strategy to promote efficient substrate channeling is to spatially organize pathway enzymes in an engineered assembly to provide kinetic driving forces that promote carbon flux in a desirable direction. Here, we report a scaffoldless, self-assembly strategy to organize Mdh, Hps, and Phi into an engineered supramolecular enzyme complex using an SH3--ligand interaction pair, which enhances methanol conversion to fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). To increase methanol consumption, an ``NADH Sink'' was created using                Escherichia coli                lactate dehydrogenase as an NADH scavenger, thereby preventing reversible formaldehyde reduction. Combination of the two strategies improved in vitro F6P production by 97-fold compared with unassembled enzymes. The beneficial effect of supramolecular enzyme assembly was also realized in vivo as the engineered enzyme assembly improved whole-cell methanol consumption rate by ninefold. This approach will ultimately allow direct coupling of enhanced F6P synthesis with other metabolic engineering strategies for the production of many desired metabolites from methanol.},

  abstract = {Abstract              Synthetic C1 assimilation holds the promise of facilitating carbon capture while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, yet practical implementation in microbial hosts remains relatively limited. Despite substantial progress in pathway design and prototyping, most efforts stay at the proof-of-concept stage, with frequent failures observed even under in vitro conditions. This review identifies seven major barriers constraining the deployment of synthetic C1 metabolism in microorganisms and proposes targeted strategies for overcoming these issues. A primary limitation is the low catalytic activity of carbon-fixing enzymes, particularly carboxylases, which restricts the overall pathway performance. In parallel, challenges in expressing multiple heterologous genes---especially those encoding metal-dependent or oxygen-sensitive enzymes---further hinder pathway functionality. At the systems level, synthetic C1 pathways often exhibit poor flux distribution, limited integration with the host metabolism, accumulation of toxic intermediates, and disruptions in redox and energy balance. These factors collectively reduce biomass formation and compromise product yields in biotechnological setups. Overcoming these interconnected challenges is essential for moving synthetic C1 assimilation beyond conceptual stages and enabling its application in scalable, efficient bioprocesses towards a circular bioeconomy.},

In this paper, we provide a protocol for a sequence-independent approach for cloning complex individual or combinatorial DNA libraries, and routine or high-throughput cloning of single or multiple DNA fragments. The strategy, called circular polymerase extension cloning (CPEC), is based on polymerase overlap extension and is therefore free of restriction digestion, ligation or single-stranded homologous recombination. CPEC is highly efficient, accurate and user friendly. Once the inserts and the linear vector have been prepared, the CPEC reaction can be completed in 10 min to 3 h, depending on the complexity of the gene libraries.},

As gasification agent oxygen, steam, or mixtures are used. The most common use of biomass gasification in the last decades has been for heat and/or power production. Nowadays, the importance of transportation fuels from renewables is increased due to environmental aspects and growing fossil fuels prices. That is why the production of Fischer--Tropsch (                FT                ) liquids, methanol, mixed alcohols, substitute natural gas (                SNG                ), and hydrogen from biomass is now in focus of view.

In eukaryotes, the CRISPR/Cas9 system utilizes a ``guide'' RNA to enable the Cas9 nuclease to make a double-strand break at a particular genome locus, which is repaired by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair enzymes, often generating random mutations in the process. A specific alteration of the target genome can also be generated by supplying a DNA template in vivo with a desired mutation, which is incorporated by homology-directed repair. However,               E. coli               lacks robust systems for double-strand break repair. Thus, in contrast to eukaryotes, targeting               E. coli               chromosomal DNA with Cas9 causes cell death. However, Cas9-mediated killing of bacteria can be exploited to select against cells with a specified genotype within a mixed population. In combination with the well described {$\lambda$}-Red system for recombination in               E. coli               , we created a highly efficient system for marker-free and scarless genome editing. \copyright{} 2017 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Recent research has raised the prospect of methanol bioconversion to value-added products using synthetic methylotrophic Escherichia coli, as its metabolism can be rewired to enable growth solely on the reduced one-carbon compound. Here we describe the generation of an E. coli strain that grows on methanol at a doubling time of 4.3\,h---comparable to many natural methylotrophs. To establish bioproduction from methanol using this synthetic chassis, we demonstrate biosynthesis from four metabolic nodes from which numerous bioproducts can be derived: lactic acid from pyruvate, polyhydroxybutyrate from acetyl coenzyme A, itaconic acid from the tricarboxylic acid cycle and p-aminobenzoic acid from the chorismate pathway. In a step towards carbon-negative chemicals and valorizing greenhouse gases, our work brings synthetic methylotrophy in E. coli within reach of industrial applications.},

  abstract = {AbstractCarbon fixation is one of the most important biochemical processes. Most natural carbon fixation pathways are thought to have emerged from enzymes that originally performed other metabolic tasks. Can we recreate the emergence of a carbon fixation pathway in a heterotrophic host by recruiting only endogenous enzymes? In this study, we address this question by systematically analyzing possible carbon fixation pathways composed only of Escherichia coli native enzymes. We identify the GED (Gnd--Entner--Doudoroff) cycle as the simplest pathway that can operate with high thermodynamic driving force. This autocatalytic route is based on reductive carboxylation of ribulose 5-phosphate (Ru5P) by 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd), followed by reactions of the Entner--Doudoroff pathway, gluconeogenesis, and the pentose phosphate pathway. We demonstrate the in vivo feasibility of this new-to-nature pathway by constructing E. coli gene deletion strains whose growth on pentose sugars depends on the GED shunt, a linear variant of the GED cycle which does not require the regeneration of Ru5P. Several metabolic adaptations, most importantly the increased production of NADPH, assist in establishing sufficiently high flux to sustain this growth. Our study exemplifies a trajectory for the emergence of carbon fixation in a heterotrophic organism and demonstrates a synthetic pathway of biotechnological interest.},

To facilitate the engineering of formaldehyde-producing enzymes, the development of sensitive, user-friendly, and cost-effective detection methods is required. In this study, we engineered                Escherichia coli                to serve as a cellular biosensor capable of detecting a broad range of formaldehyde concentrations. Using both natural and promiscuous formaldehyde assimilation enzymes, we designed three distinct                E. coli                growth biosensor strains that depend on formaldehyde for cell growth. These strains were engineered to be auxotrophic for one or several essential metabolites that could be produced through formaldehyde assimilation. The respective assimilating enzyme was expressed from the genome to compensate the auxotrophy in the presence of formaldehyde. We first predicted the formaldehyde dependency of the biosensors by flux balance analysis and then analysed it experimentally. Subsequent to strain engineering, we enhanced the formaldehyde sensitivity of two biosensors either through adaptive laboratory evolution or modifications at metabolic branch points. The final set of biosensors demonstrated the ability to detect formaldehyde concentrations ranging approximately from 30\,{$\mu$}M to 13\,mM. We demonstrated the application of the biosensors by assaying the in~vivo activity of different methanol dehydrogenases in the most sensitive strain. The fully genomic nature of the biosensors allows them to be deployed as ``plug-and-play'' devices for high-throughput screenings of extensive enzyme libraries. The formaldehyde growth biosensors developed in this study hold significant promise for advancing the field of enzyme engineering, thereby supporting the establishment of a sustainable one-carbon bioeconomy.},

This enzyme, formolase, performs a carboligation reaction, directly fixing one-carbon units into three-carbon units that feed into central metabolism. By combining formolase with several naturally occurring enzymes, we created a new carbon fixation pathway, the formolase pathway, which assimilates one-carbon units via formate. Unlike native carbon fixation pathways, this pathway is linear, not oxygen sensitive, and consists of a small number of thermodynamically favorable steps. We demonstrate in vitro pathway function as a proof of principle of how protein design in a pathway context can lead to new efficient metabolic pathways.            ,               We describe a computationally designed enzyme, formolase (FLS), which catalyzes the carboligation of three one-carbon formaldehyde molecules into one three-carbon dihydroxyacetone molecule. The existence of FLS enables the design of a new carbon fixation pathway, the formolase pathway, consisting of a small number of thermodynamically favorable chemical transformations that convert formate into a three-carbon sugar in central metabolism. The formolase pathway is predicted to use carbon more efficiently and with less backward flux than any naturally occurring one-carbon assimilation pathway. When supplemented with enzymes carrying out the other steps in the pathway, FLS converts formate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate and other central metabolites in vitro. These results demonstrate how modern protein engineering and design tools can facilitate the construction of a completely new biosynthetic pathway.},

The SEVA-DB adopts simple design concepts that facilitate the swapping of functional modules and the extension of genome engineering options to microorganisms beyond typical laboratory strains. Under the SEVA standard, every DNA portion of the plasmid vectors is minimized, edited for flaws in their sequence and/or functionality, and endowed with physical connectivity through three inter-segment insulators that are flanked by fixed, rare restriction sites. Such a scaffold enables the exchangeability of multiple origins of replication and diverse antibiotic selection markers to shape a frame for their further combination with a large variety of cargo modules that can be used for varied end-applications. The core collection of constructs that are available at the SEVA-DB has been produced as a starting point for the further expansion of the formatted vector platform. We argue that adoption of the SEVA format can become a shortcut to fill the phenomenal gap between the existing power of DNA synthesis and the actual engineering of predictable and efficacious bacteria.},

In selective media (minimal medium or Luria Broth plus ampicillin), the clone transformed with the largest plasmid (pBluescript with a 9000-bp insert) had a significantly longer lag phase than all other clones. In nonselective media the rate of plasmid loss during successive subculturings was greatest in the clone with the largest insert. The clone with the largest insert displayed a lower plasmid copy number than clones with a small insert or no insert at all. Plasmid loss in the form of segregational instability and plasmid copy number reduction in nonselective environments are important to the understanding of the evolution of the bacteria-plasmid associations and the appreciation of the potential for altering the genetic properties of a clone maintained or subcultured on a standard medium.Key words: pBluescript, plasmid, stress, fitness, starvation.},

It can introduce substitutions, deletions, insertions, and the combination thereof, both in plasmids and~the chromosome of E. coli with high fidelity. Notably, under optimal conditions, the efficiency of 1-bp deletions reach up to 40\%. Moreover, deletions of up to 97\,bp and insertions up to 33\,bp were successful with the toolkit in E. coli, however, efficiencies dropped sharply with increased fragment sizes. With a second guide RNA, our toolkit can achieve multiplexed editing albeit with low efficiency.

Here we show that the coupling of growth and production is feasible under appropriate conditions for almost all metabolites in genome-scale metabolic models of five major production organisms. These organisms comprise eukaryotes and prokaryotes as well as heterotrophic and photoautotrophic organisms, which shows that growth coupling as a strain design principle has a wide applicability. The feasibility of coupling is proven by calculating appropriate reaction knockouts, which enforce the coupling behaviour. The study presented here is the most comprehensive computational investigation of growth-coupled production so far and its results are of fundamental importance for rational metabolic engineering.},

  abstract = {Lactate has gained increasing attention as a platform chemical, particularly for the production of the bioplastic poly-lactic acid (PLA). While current microbial lactate production processes primarily rely on the use of sugars as carbon sources, it is possible to envision a future where lactate can be produced from sustainable, non-food substrates. Methanol could be such a potential substrate, as it can be produced by (electro)chemical hydrogenation from CO2. In this study, the use of the methylotrophic yeast Ogataea polymorpha as a host organism for lactate production from methanol was explored. To enable lactate production in O. polymorpha, four different lactate dehydrogenases were expressed under the control of the methanol-inducible MOX promoter. The L-lactate dehydrogenase of Lactobacillus helveticus performed well in the yeast, and the lactate production of this engineered strain could additionally be improved by conducting methanol fed-batch experiments in shake flasks. Further, the impact of different nitrogen sources and the resulting pH levels on production was examined more closely. In order to increase methanol assimilation of the lactate-producing strain, an adaptive laboratory evolution experiment was performed. Through this experiment, the growth rate of the lactate-producing strain on methanol was increased by 55 \%, while at the same time lactate production was preserved. The highest lactate titer of 3.8 g/L in this study was obtained by cultivating this evolved strain in a methanol fed-batch experiment in shake flasks with urea as nitrogen source. This study provides a proof of principle that O. polymorpha is a suitable host organism for the production of lactate using methanol as carbon source. In addition, it offers guidance for the engineering of methylotrophic organisms that produce platform chemicals from CO2-derived substrates. With reduced land use, this technology will promote the development of a sustainable industrial biotechnology in the future.},

  abstract = {Global energy-related emissions, in particular carbon dioxide, are rapidly increasing. Without immediate and strong reductions across all sectors, limiting global warming to 1.5~{$^\circ$}C and thus mitigating climate change is beyond reach. In addition to the expansion of renewable energies and the increase in energy efficiency, the so-called Carbon Capture and Utilization technologies represent an innovative approach for closing the carbon cycle and establishing a circular economy. One option is to combine CO2 capture with microbial C1 fermentation. C1-molecules, such as methanol or formate are considered as attractive alternative feedstock for biotechnological processes due to their sustainable production using only CO2, water and renewable energy. Native methylotrophic microorganisms can utilize these feedstock for the production of value-added compounds. Currently, constraints exist regarding the understanding of methylotrophic metabolism and the available genetic engineering tools are limited. For this reason, the development of synthetic methylotrophic cell factories based on the integration of natural or artificial methanol assimilation pathways in biotechnologically relevant microorganisms is receiving special attention. Yeasts like Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Yarrowia lipolytica are capable of producing important products from sugar-based feedstock and the switch to produce these in the future from methanol is important in order to realize a CO2-based economy that is independent from land use. Here, we review historical biotechnological applications, the metabolism and the characteristics of methylotrophic yeasts. Various studies demonstrated the production of a broad set of promising products from fine chemicals to bulk chemicals by applying methylotrophic yeasts. Regarding synthetic methylotrophy, the deep understanding of the methylotrophic metabolism serves as the basis for microbial strain engineering and paves the way towards a CO2-based circular bioeconomy. We highlight design aspects of synthetic methylotrophy and discuss the resulting chances and challenges using non-conventional yeasts as host organisms. We conclude that the road towards synthetic methylotrophic yeasts can only be achieved through a combination of methods (e.g., metabolic engineering and adaptive laboratory evolution). Furthermore, we presume that the installation of metabolic regeneration cycles such as supporting carbon re-entry towards the pentose phosphate pathway from C1-metabolism is a pivotal target for synthetic methylotrophy.},

Currently, such regeneration routes are tested and characterized mainly in vitro before being introduced into the cell. However, in vitro measurements could be misleading as they do not reflect enzyme activity under physiological conditions. Here, we construct an in vivo platform to test and compare NADH regeneration systems. By deleting dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase in                Escherichia coli                , we abolish the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. When cultivated on acetate, the resulting strain is auxotrophic to NADH and ATP: acetate can be assimilated via the glyoxylate shunt but cannot be oxidized to provide the cell with reducing power and energy. This strain can, therefore, serve to select for and test different NADH regeneration routes. We exemplify this by comparing several NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenases and methanol dehydrogenases. We identify the most efficient enzyme variants under in vivo conditions and pinpoint optimal feedstock concentrations that maximize NADH biosynthesis while avoiding cellular toxicity. Our strain thus provides a useful platform for comparing and optimizing enzymatic systems for cofactor regeneration under physiological conditions.},

With the aim to turn methanol into a suitable feedstock for microbial production processes, we engineered the industrially important but nonmethylotrophic bacterium               Corynebacterium glutamicum               toward the utilization of methanol as an auxiliary carbon source in a sugar-based medium. Initial oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde was achieved by heterologous expression of a methanol dehydrogenase from               Bacillus methanolicus               , whereas assimilation of formaldehyde was realized by implementing the two key enzymes of the ribulose monophosphate pathway of               Bacillus subtilis               : 3-hexulose-6-phosphate synthase and 6-phospho-3-hexuloisomerase. The recombinant               C. glutamicum               strain showed an average methanol consumption rate of 1.7 \textpm{} 0.3 mM/h (mean \textpm{} standard deviation) in a glucose-methanol medium, and the culture grew to a higher cell density than in medium without methanol. In addition, [               13               C]methanol-labeling experiments revealed labeling fractions of 3 to 10\% in the m + 1 mass isotopomers of various intracellular metabolites. In the background of a               C. glutamicum               {$\Delta$}               ald               {$\Delta$}               adhE               mutant being strongly impaired in its ability to oxidize formaldehyde to CO               2               , the m + 1 labeling of these intermediates was increased (8 to 25\%), pointing toward higher formaldehyde assimilation capabilities of this strain. The engineered               C. glutamicum               strains represent a promising starting point for the development of sugar-based biotechnological production processes using methanol as an auxiliary substrate.},

  abstract = {Formaldehyde is a prevalent environmental toxin and a key intermediate in single carbon metabolism. The ability to monitor formaldehyde concentration is, therefore, of interest for both environmental monitoring and for metabolic engineering of native and synthetic methylotrophs, but current methods suffer from low sensitivity, complex workflows, or require expensive analytical equipment. Here we develop a formaldehyde biosensor based on the FrmR repressor protein and cognate promoter of                  Escherichia coli                  . Optimization of the native repressor binding site and regulatory architecture enabled detection at levels as low as 1\,\textmu M. We then used the sensor to benchmark the in vivo activity of several NAD-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) variants, the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the first step of methanol assimilation. In order to use this biosensor to distinguish individuals in a mixed population of Mdh variants, we developed a strategy to prevent cross-talk by using glutathione as a formaldehyde sink to minimize intercellular formaldehyde diffusion. Finally, we applied this biosensor to balance expression of                  mdh                  and the formaldehyde assimilation enzymes                  hps                  and                  phi                  in an engineered                  E. coli                  strain to minimize formaldehyde build-up while also reducing the burden of heterologous expression. This biosensor offers a quick and simple method for sensitively detecting formaldehyde, and has the potential to be used as the basis for directed evolution of Mdh and dynamic formaldehyde control strategies for establishing synthetic methylotrophy.                                          ,                               A formaldehyde biosensor was constructed from the native                E. coli                frm promoter/repressor pair, and the promoter region rationally mutated to improve sensitivity. The biosensor was used to evaluate the kinetics of various methanol dehydrogenase (Mdh) enzymes, and a modification of the assay was developed to enable discrimination of Mdhs within a mixed population, and allow high-throughput promoter tuning to balance formaldehyde flux in engineered cells. The sensor will be useful in ongoing efforts to engineer synthetic methylotrophy.},

  abstract = {Due to volatile sugar prices, the food vs fuel debate, and recent increases in the supply of natural gas, methanol has emerged as a promising feedstock for the bio-based economy. However, attempts to engineer Escherichia coli to metabolize methanol have achieved limited success. Here, we provide a rigorous systematic analysis of several potential pathway bottlenecks. We show that regeneration of ribulose 5-phosphate in E. coli is insufficient to sustain methanol assimilation, and overcome this by activating the sedoheptulose bisphosphatase variant of the ribulose monophosphate pathway. By leveraging the kinetic isotope effect associated with deuterated methanol as a chemical probe, we further demonstrate that under these conditions overall pathway flux is kinetically limited by methanol dehydrogenase. Finally, we identify NADH as a potent kinetic inhibitor of this enzyme. These results provide direction for future engineering strategies to improve methanol utilization, and underscore the value of chemical biology methodologies in metabolic engineering.},

  abstract = {One-carbon (C1) substrates, such as methanol or formate, are attractive feedstocks for circular bioeconomy. These substrates are typically converted into formaldehyde, serving as the entry point into metabolism. Here, we design an erythrulose monophosphate (EuMP) cycle for formaldehyde assimilation, leveraging a promiscuous dihydroxyacetone phosphate dependent aldolase as key enzyme. In silico modeling reveals that the cycle is highly energy-efficient, holding the potential for high bioproduct yields. Dissecting the EuMP into four modules, we use a stepwise strategy to demonstrate in vivo feasibility of the modules in E. coli sensor strains with sarcosine as formaldehyde source. From adaptive laboratory evolution for module integration, we identify key mutations enabling the accommodation of the EuMP reactions with endogenous metabolism. Overall, our study demonstrates the proof-of-concept for a highly efficient, new-to-nature formaldehyde assimilation pathway, opening a way for the development of a methylotrophic platform for a C1-fueled bioeconomy in the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract                              Methanol is a valuable raw material used in the manufacture of useful chemicals as well as a potential source of energy to replace coal and petroleum. Biotechnological interest in the microbial utilization of methanol has increased because it is an ideal carbon source and can be produced from renewable biomass. Formaldehyde, a cytotoxic compound, is a central metabolic intermediate in methanol metabolism. Therefore, microorganisms utilizing methanol have adopted several metabolic strategies to cope with the toxicity of formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is initially detoxified through trapping by some cofactors, such as glutathione, mycothiol, tetrahydrofolate, and tetrahydromethanopterin, before being oxidized to CO                2                . Alternatively, free formaldehyde can be trapped by sugar phosphates as the first reaction in the C                1                assimilation pathways: the xylulose monophosphate pathway for yeasts and the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway for bacteria. In yeasts, although formaldehyde generation and consumption takes place in the peroxisome, the cytosolic formaldehyde oxidation pathway also plays a role in formaldehyde detoxification as well as energy formation. The key enzymes of the RuMP pathway are found in a variety of microorganisms including bacteria and archaea. Regulation of the genes encoding these enzymes and their catalytic mechanisms depend on the physiological traits of these organisms during evolution. \copyright{} 2005 The Japan Chemical Journal Forum and Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although proper functioning of metabolic pathways relies on precise control of enzyme levels, the experimental ability to balance the levels of many genes in parallel is a major outstanding challenge. Here, we introduce a rapid and modular method to span the expression space of several proteins in parallel. By combinatorially pairing genes with a compact set of ribosome-binding sites, we modulate protein abundance by several orders of magnitude. We demonstrate our strategy by using a synthetic operon containing fluorescent proteins to span a 3D color space. Using the same approach, we modulate a recombinant carotenoid biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli to reveal a diversity of phenotypes, each characterized by a distinct carotenoid accumulation profile. In a single combinatorial assembly, we achieve a yield of the industrially valuable compound astaxanthin 4-fold higher than previously reported. The methodology presented here provides an efficient tool for exploring a high-dimensional expression space to locate desirable phenotypes.},

In recent years, genetic engineering towards native menthol utilizing organisms -- methylotrophy has developed rapidly and attracted widespread attention. Therefore, it is vital to elucidate the distinct pathways that involve methanol oxidation, formaldehyde assimilation and disassimilation in the different methylotrophies for future synthetic work. In addition, this will also help to genetically construct some new and non-native methylotrophies. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the methanol metabolism pathways in methylotrophy, discusses and compares different pathways on methanol utilization, and finally presents the strategies to integrate the methanol metabolism with other chemicals, biofuels or other high value-added product formation pathways.},

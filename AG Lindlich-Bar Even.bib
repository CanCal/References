  abstract = {In the cell, NAD(H) and NADP(H) cofactors have different functions. The former mainly accepts electrons from catabolic reactions and carries them to respiration, while the latter provides reducing power for anabolism.            ,               ABSTRACT                              The nicotinamide cofactor specificity of enzymes plays a key role in regulating metabolic processes and attaining cellular homeostasis. Multiple studies have used enzyme engineering tools or a directed evolution approach to switch the cofactor preference of specific oxidoreductases. However, whole-cell adaptation toward the emergence of novel cofactor regeneration routes has not been previously explored. To address this challenge, we used an                Escherichia coli                NADPH-auxotrophic strain. We continuously cultivated this strain under selective conditions. After 500 to 1,100 generations of adaptive evolution using different carbon sources, we isolated several strains capable of growing without an external NADPH source. Most isolated strains were found to harbor a mutated NAD                +                -dependent malic enzyme (MaeA). A single mutation in MaeA was found to switch cofactor specificity while lowering enzyme activity. Most mutated MaeA variants also harbored a second mutation that restored the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. Remarkably, the best MaeA variants identified this way displayed overall superior kinetics relative to the wild-type variant with NAD                +                . In other evolved strains, the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd) was mutated to accept NADP                +                , thus enabling the pyruvate dehydrogenase and 2-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexes to regenerate NADPH. Interestingly, no other central metabolism oxidoreductase seems to evolve toward reducing NADP                +                , which we attribute to several biochemical constraints, including unfavorable thermodynamics. This study demonstrates the potential and biochemical limits of evolving oxidoreductases within the cellular context toward changing cofactor specificity, further showing that long-term adaptive evolution can optimize enzyme activity beyond what is achievable via rational design or directed evolution using small libraries.                                            IMPORTANCE                In the cell, NAD(H) and NADP(H) cofactors have different functions. The former mainly accepts electrons from catabolic reactions and carries them to respiration, while the latter provides reducing power for anabolism. Correspondingly, the ratio of the reduced to the oxidized form differs for NAD                +                (low) and NADP                +                (high), reflecting their distinct roles. We challenged the flexibility of                E. coli                's                central metabolism in multiple adaptive evolution experiments using an NADPH-auxotrophic strain. We found several mutations in two enzymes, changing the cofactor preference of malic enzyme and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase. Upon deletion of their corresponding genes we performed additional evolution experiments which did not lead to the emergence of any additional mutants. We attribute this restricted number of mutational targets to intrinsic thermodynamic barriers; the high ratio of NADPH to NADP                +                limits metabolic redox reactions that can regenerate NADPH, mainly by mass action constraints.},

  abstract = {Engineering a biotechnological microorganism for growth on one-carbon intermediates, produced from the abiotic activation of CO2, is a key synthetic biology step towards the valorization of this greenhouse gas to commodity chemicals. Here we redesign the central carbon metabolism of the model bacterium Escherichia coli for growth on one-carbon compounds using the reductive glycine pathway. Sequential genomic introduction of the four metabolic modules of the synthetic pathway resulted in a strain capable of growth on formate and CO2 with a doubling time of \textasciitilde 70\,h and growth yield of \textasciitilde 1.5\,g cell dry weight (gCDW) per mol-formate. Short-term evolution decreased doubling time to less than 8\,h and improved biomass yield to 2.3\,gCDW per mol-formate. Growth on methanol and CO2 was achieved by further expression of a methanol dehydrogenase. Establishing synthetic formatotrophy and methylotrophy, as demonstrated here, paves the way for sustainable bioproduction rooted in CO2 and renewable energy.},

  abstract = {Microbial C1 fixation has a vast potential to support a sustainable circular economy. Hence, several biotechnologically important microorganisms have been recently engineered for fixing C1 substrates. However, reports about C1-based bioproduction with these organisms are scarce. Here, we describe the optimization of a previously engineered formatotrophic Escherichia coli strain. Short-term adaptive laboratory evolution enhanced biomass yield and accelerated growth of formatotrophic E. coli to 3.3 g-CDW/mol-formate and 6 hours doubling time, respectively. Genome sequence analysis revealed that manipulation of acetate metabolism is the reason for better growth performance, verified by subsequent reverse engineering of the parental E. coli strain. Moreover, the improved strain is capable of growing to an OD600 of 22 in bioreactor fed-batch experiments, highlighting its potential use for industrial bioprocesses. Finally, demonstrating the strain's potential to support a sustainable, formate-based bioeconomy, lactate production from formate and CO2 was engineered. The optimized strain generated 1.2 mM lactate---10 \% of the theoretical maximum---providing the first proof-of-concept application of the reductive glycine pathway for bioproduction.},

Here, we use a synthetic biology approach to recreate such an evolutionary setup in central metabolism and explore how cellular physiology adjusts to enable recursive catalysis. We generate an                Escherichia coli                strain deleted in transketolase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, effectively eliminating the native pentose phosphate pathway. We demonstrate that the overexpression of phosphoketolase restores prototrophic growth by catalyzing three consecutive reactions, cleaving xylulose 5-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and, notably, sedoheptulose 7-phosphate. We find that the activity of the resulting synthetic pathway becomes possible due to the recalibration of steady-state concentrations of key metabolites, such that the                in vivo                cleavage rates of all three phosphoketolase substrates are similar. This study demonstrates our ability to rewrite one of nature's most conserved pathways and provides insight into the flexibility of cellular metabolism during pathway emergence.},

Their realization through in vitro enzyme characterization and engineering is mostly low throughput and labor-intensive. Therefore, strategies for increasing throughput while diminishing manual labor are gaining momentum, such as in vivo screening and evolution campaigns. Computational tools like machine learning further support enzyme engineering efforts by widening the explorable design space. Here, we propose an integrated solution to enzyme engineering challenges whereby ML-guided, automated workflows (including library generation, implementation of hypermutation systems, adapted laboratory evolution, and in vivo growth-coupled selection) could be realized to accelerate pipelines towards superior biocatalysts.},

  abstract = {Ammonium (NH4+) is essential to generate the nitrogenous building blocks of life. It gets assimilated via the canonical biosynthetic routes to glutamate and is further distributed throughout metabolism via a network of transaminases. To study the flexibility of this network, we constructed an Escherichia coli glutamate auxotrophic strain. This strain allowed us to systematically study which amino acids serve as amine sources. We found that several amino acids complemented the auxotrophy either by producing glutamate via transamination reactions or by their conversion to glutamate. In this network, we identified aspartate transaminase AspC as a major connector between many amino acids and glutamate. Additionally, we extended the transaminase network by the amino acids {$\beta$}-alanine, alanine, glycine, and serine as new amine sources and identified d-amino acid dehydrogenase (DadA) as an intracellular amino acid sink removing substrates from transaminase reactions. Finally, ammonium assimilation routes producing aspartate or leucine were introduced. Our study reveals the high flexibility of the cellular amination network, both in terms of transaminase promiscuity and adaptability to new connections and ammonium entry points.},

However, the need for redox balancing limits the array of fermentable substrate-product combinations. To overcome this limitation, here we design an aerobic fermentative metabolism that allows the introduction of selected respiratory modules. These can use oxygen to re-balance otherwise unbalanced fermentations, hence achieving controlled respiro-fermentative growth. Following this design, we engineer and characterize an obligate fermentative Escherichia coli strain that aerobically ferments glucose to stoichiometric amounts of lactate. We then re-integrate the quinone-dependent glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and demonstrate glycerol fermentation to lactate while selectively transferring the surplus of electrons to the respiratory chain. To showcase the potential of this fermentation mode, we direct fermentative flux from glycerol towards isobutanol production. In summary, our design permits using oxygen to selectively re-balance fermentations. This concept is an advance freeing highly efficient microbial fermentation from the limitations imposed by traditional redox balancing.},
